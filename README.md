# Flopay 🧾⚡

**Flopay** is a decentralized digital payments platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP). Inspired by platforms like Fawry, Vodafone Cash, and InstaPay, Flopay goes one step further by enabling **offline-friendly**, **peer-to-peer**, and **secure** transactions—without relying on centralized data centers.

## 🚨 The Problem

In Egypt and many regions of Africa and the Middle East, digital payment platforms are heavily centralized. This causes several issues:

- If a central data center is compromised (e.g., due to a fire in a telecom hub), users are completely cut off from sending or receiving money.
- Rural or low-connectivity areas struggle to access these services reliably.
- Offline transactions are nearly impossible.

**Example:** In 2025, a fire at a major central telecom facility led to a nationwide outage, preventing thousands of users from completing digital payments—highlighting the risks of centralization.
